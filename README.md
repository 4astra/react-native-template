### Note
Create React Native App is the easiest way to start building a new React Native application. It allows you to start a project without installing or configuring any tools to build native code - no Xcode or Android Studio installation required (see Caveats).
Assuming that you have Node installed, you can use npm to install the create-react-native-app command line utility:
```bash
npm install -g create-react-native-app
```
